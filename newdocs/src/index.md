# QuantEcon.jl

*QuantEcon.jl* is a [Julia](http://www.julialang.org) package for doing quantitative economics.

The library is split into two modules: `QuantEcon` and `QuantEcon.Models`. The main `QuantEcon` module includes various tools and the `QuantEcon.Models` module leverages these tools to provide implementations of standard economic models.

Many of the concepts in the library are discussed in the lectures on the website [quant-econ.net](http://quant-econ.net).

For a listing of the functions, methods, and types provided by the library see the [Overview] page.

For more detailed documentation of each object in each of the two modules see the Library/[QuantEcon](@ref) and Library/[QuantEcon.Models] pages.

Some examples of usage can be found in the [examples directory](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.jl/tree/master/examples) or the listing of [exercise solutions](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.jl/tree/master/solutions/) that accompany the lectures on [quant-econ.net](http://quant-econ.net).
